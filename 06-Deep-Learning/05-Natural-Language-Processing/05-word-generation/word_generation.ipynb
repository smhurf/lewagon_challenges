    "⚠️ **Warning** ⚠️ The `load_data` function has a `percentage_of_sentences` argument. Depending on your computer, there are chances that a too large number of sentences will make your compute slow down, or even freeze - your RAM can even overflow. For that reason, you can start with 20% of the sentences and see if your computer handles it. Otherwise, rerun with a lower number. On the other hand, you can increase the number if you feel like it.
