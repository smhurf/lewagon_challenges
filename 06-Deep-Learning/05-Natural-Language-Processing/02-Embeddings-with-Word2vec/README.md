# Week 06 - Deep Learning - Day 5 - Understand embedding with Word2Vec


In this notebook, we will look at word2vec, a technique for word embedding.

The goal of word2vec is to provide a mapping from the dictionary of words present in a text to vectors of fixed dimension. The main motivation is that working on words directly is not possible.

This exercise will make you better understand the embeddings in general.

## Requirement
