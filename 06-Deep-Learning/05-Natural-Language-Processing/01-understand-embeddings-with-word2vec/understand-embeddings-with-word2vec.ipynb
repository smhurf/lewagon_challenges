However, if you have finished an exercise and you feel confortable with what you have, you are welcome to improve the data cleaning to achieve better performances.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Good Practice** ✅ Never spend too much time on data cleaning! First, build the entire pipeline to have a baseline evaluation of your task. **Then, and only then, improve your data cleaning and _watch_ if it is really improving your score**. Otherwise, if you work on your data cleaning without baseline evaluation of your performances, you don't know whether your fancy data cleaning is improving the entire pipeline or not. And sometimes, it can get super counterintuitive ;)\n",

    "⚠️ **Warning** ⚠️ The `load_data` function has a `percentage_of_sentences` argument. Depending on your computer, there are chances that a too large number of sentences will make your compute slow down, or even freeze - your RAM can even overflow. For that reason, you can start with 20% of the sentences and see if your computer handles it. Otherwise, rerun with a lower number. On the other hand, you can increase the number if you feel like it.
