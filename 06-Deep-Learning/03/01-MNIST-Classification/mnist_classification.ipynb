    "Let's imagine for a moment that you are working for the postal office (and you're in 1970 / 1980). You deal everyday with a enourmous amont of letters, and you want to automate the process of reading the numbers that have been handwritten. This task, called the _Handwriting Recognition_, has been a very complex that has been handled by Bell Labs (among other) where Yann Le Cun used to work, and where such things have been developed : \n",

    "You goal in this notebook is to build your first Convolution Neural Network that can work on such images and predict the corresponding class of each digit image. Keep in mind that your first simple CNN will make you classify hand-written digits, which was a very complex task till the 90's. \n",
