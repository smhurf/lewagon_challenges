## Central Limit Theorem

Last but not least, let's verify experimentally the theorem together.

In this exercice, we will use the "tips" dataset to select randomly many dinners and add their associated tips one by one.

We will see that as the number of selected diners gets large enough, the mean of all the tips converges toward a Normal distribution of well known properties, that we can exploit to provide meaningful probabilistic conclusions.
