## Create a budget alert

All GCP services are paying, and remember that you entered your credit card in GCP on setup day.

Let's create an expense alert and keep an eye on your budget 💸

Creating a budget alert will allow you to be notified when your expense thresholds are reached.

It will allow you to fine tune your usage of the Google Cloud Platform.

Open the [GCP console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)...

Go to Billing / Budgets & alerts
