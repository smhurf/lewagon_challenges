## Background & Objectives

`Sqlite` is a simple database that relies on a standalone file.
You can read more about it on [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite).

## Tooling

Use **DBeaver** to read the SQLite database, explore the schema and even **run SQL queries**.

- [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/)

## Specs

The goal of this exercise is to explore the Movies database, and understand its schema. Answer the following questions:

- What is the database schema? (i.e what are the tables, and the relations between tables)
- Use SQL Design tool to draw the schema of this database.
- How many rows does each table contain? What are the column names for each table?

Use [db.lewagon.com](http://db.lewagon.com/) to draw the Movies schema. Save it in XML format to `movies.xml` and check it with `make`.
