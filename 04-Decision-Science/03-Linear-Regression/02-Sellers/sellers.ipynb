    "From now on, exploratory notebooks are going get pretty very long, and we strongly advice you to follow these notebook principles\n",
    "- Code your logic so that your Notebook can always be run from top to bottom without crashing (Cell --> Run All)\n",
    "- Name your variables carefully \n",
    "- Use dummy names such as `tmp` for intermediary steps when you know you won't need them long\n",
    "- Clear your code and merge cells when relevant (`Shit-M`) to merge two cells to minimize Notebook size\n",
    "- Hide your cell output if you don't need to see it anymore (double click on the red `Out[]:` section to the left of your cell).\n",
    "- Make heavy use of jupyber nbextention `Collapsable Headings` and `Table of Content` (call a TA if you can't find them)\n",
    "- Use the following shortcuts \n",
    "    - `a` to insert a cell above\n",
    "    - `b` to insert a cell below\n",
    "    - `dd` to delete a cell\n",
    "    - `esc` and `arrows` to move between cells\n",
    "    - `shit-Enter` to execute cell and move focus to the next one\n",
