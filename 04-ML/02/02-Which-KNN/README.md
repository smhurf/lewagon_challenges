Binary classification with kNN - <a href="https://blog.eduonix.com/artificial-intelligence/everything-need-know-k-nearest-neighbors-algorithm/">blog.eduonix.com</a>

### Introduction

In this exercice we are going to find the **most accurate** **k** for a **kNN classifier**.
We are still trying to differenciate **pro** from **amateur** basket-ball players.

**Dataset:** `../data/Basket_Ball_Players.csv`

**Columns:**
**Height**, range [150, 220], height in centimeter
**3-Pointers**, range [0, 30], 3-Pointers done in one minutes
**Pro-Player**, range [0,1]

To start the exercise open `01-Which-KNN.ipynb` in `jupyter notebook`.

### Exercise questions:

1. What is the **error rate** with **k=1**?
2. Which **k** give us the best **accuracy**?
3. What is the **accuracy** of the **best k**?
4. With the best **k**, is Paul classified as a **Pro-Player**?
