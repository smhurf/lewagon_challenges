### Introduction

In this exercice we are going to find how **accurate** is our **kNN classifier**.
We will also try to differenciate **pro** from **amateur** basket-ball players.

**Dataset:** "../data/Basket_Ball_Players.csv

**Columns:** 
**"Height"**, range [150, 220], height in centimeter 
**"3-Pointers"**, range [0, 30], 3-Pointers done in one minutes
**"Pro-Player"**, range [0,1]

To start the exercise open `01-Classifier-Accuracy.ipynb` in `jupyter notebook`.

### Exercise questions:

1. With **k=1**, is Paul classified as a **Pro-Player**?
2. What is the **error rate** with **k=1**?
