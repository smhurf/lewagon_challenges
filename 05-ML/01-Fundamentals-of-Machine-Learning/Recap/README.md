# Recap

In this Recap, you are going to use a K-Nearest-Neighbors model to find data observations that are similar to one another, or complete opposites.

You will then get a first glimpse at the effects of data scaling on Machine learning modelling.

To start the recap, open `Recap.ipynb` in `jupyter notebook`.

🚀 Your turn!
